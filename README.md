# README Generator

This is just a small project that was made to help create a readme generator which is something I've always needed. It's also allowed me learn some new technologies in the process!

It is a Svelte-based application designed to streamline the process of creating and managing project documentation. This tool allows users to easily generate, edit, and format README files, making it an essential utility for developers
